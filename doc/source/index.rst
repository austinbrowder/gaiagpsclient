GaiaGPS Python Client documentation
===================================

This is the documentation for the `gaiagpsclient <https://github.com/kk7ds/gaiagpsclient>`_ library and utility.

In short, this is a command-line utility for interacting with
`gaiagps.com <https://www.gaiagps.com>`_. It can help perform and automate many normal tasks, as
well as do some tricks that are not possible with the official
website. It works on all platforms.

For developers, it provides a python API for interacting with the
service as well.
